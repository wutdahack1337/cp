# My Path of Problem Solving
> Bắt chước Um_nik

## Step 1. Read the statement
Read the statement carefully.
Notice weird, unexpected things.
Make note of limitations, especially if they are low or unexpected.

## Step 2. Make observations
Make observations.   
If you can't see anything, add more limitations, and try to solve more constrained (easier) version of the problems. Is there something that works for the general case too?

## Step 3. Reread the problem statement
Reread the problem statement. Did you understand the problem correctly?

## Step 4. Think about implementation
Calculate the complexity.   
Think about implementation.  
What function do you need?  
Which places are tricky? What you need to remember?  
Which places is the heaviest by implementation?  
Which places is the slowest? Can you do them better/simpler?  

## Step 5. Before submit
Reread the problem statement. Did you understand the problem correctly?  
Reread the code.  
Recall the tricky places. Did you remember to do everything to handle them?  
Recall the solution. It is correct?  

## Step 6. If not AC
Write stress-test.   
If no countertest was found: Reread the problem statement. Did you understand the problem correctly? Is your stupid solution definitely stupid?  

## Step 7. Get AC
Get AC. Celebrate.  
Reflect. What could you have done better? What areas took you more time than you would like? Are there any tricks to simplify the implementation?
